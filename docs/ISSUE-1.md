# Issue #1: Autoinstall Improvements

## Problem Description

The current Docker setup for the CiviCRM-Drupal application has several autoinstall issues that affect reliability and user experience during initial setup and container startup:

1. **Environment Loading**: Environment variables may not be properly loaded or validated during container initialization
2. **Database Readiness**: The application may attempt to connect to the database before it's fully ready, causing startup failures
3. **Drush Detection**: The Drush CLI tool detection and execution may be unreliable, affecting automated setup processes

## Current State Analysis

Based on the existing `docker/Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`:

- The container includes the `cv` CLI tool for CiviCRM management
- Database connection relies on environment variables (`DRUPAL_DB_HOST`, `DRUPAL_DB_NAME`, etc.)
- The setup uses MariaDB with dependency management via `depends_on`
- Composer is used for dependency management and compilation

## Changes Made in Entrypoint

*This section will be updated as entrypoint modifications are implemented*

### Environment Loading Improvements
- [ ] Enhanced environment variable validation
- [ ] Added fallback mechanisms for missing variables
- [ ] Improved error messaging for configuration issues

### Database Wait Implementation
- [ ] Added database readiness checks
- [ ] Implemented connection retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Enhanced logging for database connection status

### Drush Detection Enhancements
- [ ] Improved Drush availability detection
- [ ] Added fallback mechanisms for Drush operations
- [ ] Enhanced error handling for CLI tool execution

## Suggested Next Steps

### Short-term Improvements
1. **Install MySQL Client**: Add `mysql-client` to the runtime image for better database connectivity testing
2. **Add Health Checks**: Implement container health checks to verify service readiness
3. **Improve Logging**: Enhance startup logging for better debugging

### Medium-term Enhancements
1. **Startup Scripts**: Create dedicated startup scripts for initialization sequences
2. **Configuration Validation**: Add comprehensive configuration validation
3. **Recovery Mechanisms**: Implement automatic recovery for common failure scenarios

### Testing Strategy
1. **Integration Tests**: Add tests for the complete startup sequence
2. **Failure Scenarios**: Test behavior during database unavailability
3. **Environment Validation**: Test with various configuration scenarios

## Implementation Notes

- All changes should maintain backward compatibility
- Focus on graceful degradation when external dependencies are unavailable
- Prioritize clear error messages for troubleshooting
- Keep the minimal runtime image approach
